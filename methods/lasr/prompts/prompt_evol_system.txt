You are given 3D points forming a closed, centrally symmetric surface. Cross-sections in the coordinate planes look like rounded squares; curvature concentrates near the coordinate axes. The shape is invariant to sign flips and permutations of x, y, z.
Construct an interpretable symbolic expression that captures a closed, origin-centered surface with identical behavior along all axes and even symmetry. Prefer compact algebraic structure; avoid trigonometric terms unless essential.
surface benchl: The surface exhibits a complex topology with open regions and no self-intersections. It features periodic lobes along the x and y axes, with varying curvature that creates localized waists and saddles. Anisotropic behavior is observed, with scaling trends that diverge from the origin, leading to a banded occupancy pattern that appears and disappears along specific directions.
