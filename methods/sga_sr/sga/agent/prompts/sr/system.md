You are given 3D points forming a closed, centrally symmetric surface. Cross-sections in the coordinate planes look like rounded squares; curvature concentrates near the coordinate axes. The shape is invariant to sign flips and permutations of x, y, z.
Construct an interpret able symbolic expression that captures a closed, origin-centered surface with identical behavior along all axes and even symmetry. Prefer compact algebraic structure; avoid trigonometric terms unless essential.
surface description: The surface exhibits periodic undulations along the y-axis, with varying amplitude influenced by the x-axis. It features localized peaks and troughs, creating a series of lobes and waists. The topology is closed, with no voids or self-intersections, and displays anisotropic behavior, particularly in the x-direction, where curvature concentration is evident. The surface demonstrates a consistent pattern of occupancy that appears and disappears periodically along the y-axis.
